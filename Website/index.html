            <h2> Postmortem</h2>
            <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:black; padding: 1em;"> 
                In Iteration 2, we worked mostly with our database which took most of our time to set up. Due to that we weren't able to complete as much features.
                We idendified that we have to handle hard issues together.
                Things went more smoothly in iteration 3 as we helped eachother more when we were stuck and completed features faster.
            </p>

            <div class="overview-col"style="background-color: lightpink;">
                <h3>What took the most time? The least? Any surprises? </h3>
                <p> Setting up and using the database took the most of our time. The easiest and least time consuming was anything layout-related.
                    There wasn't really any surprises. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="overview-col" style="background-color: lightblue;">
                
                <h3>How did the project change from your initial (iteration 0) vision or stories, or did it work out as predicted?</h3>
                <p> When we started iteration 0, we had a lot of big plans including the core of our app. We found out pretty fast that we would have to be more ideal and after 
                    that it was smooth sailing. </p>
            </div>
            
          


            <div class="overview-col" style="background-color: lightpink;">
                <h3> Can you draw any conclusions from what youâ€™ve done?
                </h3>
                <p> It takes a lot of effort to work with and organize as a group. If planning isn't done well, it's very easy for each 
                    member of a team to have different visions and end goal. Communication is very important.

                In the first iteration (0), we assumed we would spend a lot of time learning android studio but we underestimated how much time we would actually need
                learning the application.
                In the next one, we didnt expect to get stuck by the database and mis-estimated by more. In the last iteration, 
                we spent a bit longer than we anticipated because of minor bugs during testing.We were also a bit over confident on what we 
                could achieve.
